## Slide 16: Action Accelerator
**Your Immediate Action Step:**
Identify your Momentum Preservation Minimumâ€”the specific 5-15 minute daily action that would maintain critical business momentum during your most challenging life circumstance.
Create a specific "emergency protocol" that ensures this action happens regardless of external conditions.
Test this protocol during a normal week to verify its effectiveness.
