## Slide 3: Introduction - The Problem
**Decision Fatigue Drains Mom Entrepreneurs**
- Average adult makes 35,000 decisions daily
- Each choice depletes mental energy
- Motherhood adds hundreds of additional decisions
- Business ownership requires complex judgment calls

## Slide 11: Real Mom Application - Jasmine
**Jasmine: Service Provider with Three Children**
- Decision Audit: Identified meal planning as major energy drain
- Standardization: Created two-week rotating meal schedule
- Automation: Implemented grocery delivery with saved lists
- Delegation: Assigned age-appropriate meal prep to children
- Batching: Established Sunday planning for all weekly meals
**Result: Eliminated 15+ daily decisions and reclaimed 5 hours weekly**

## Slide 14: Exercise - Decision System Mapping
**Map YOUR Decision Elimination System**
1. Decision Audit: What choices consume disproportionate mental energy?
2. Standardization: What default options or rules could eliminate these decisions?
3. Automation: What technology could make choices automatically?
4. Delegation: What decisions could others handle within clear parameters?
5. Batching: What choices could be grouped into dedicated decision sessions?
