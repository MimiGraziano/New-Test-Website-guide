## Problem Section

### The Traditional Wealth-Building Approach Is Failing Moms

Most wealth-building strategies were designed by people without kids, for people without kids.

They assume you have:
- Long, uninterrupted focus blocks
- Consistent daily schedules
- The luxury of putting money first
- Hours to research investments
- Energy left after taking care of everyone else

**No wonder you're exhausted, overwhelmed, and not seeing results.**

You're trying to follow a wealth-building blueprint that was never meant for your reality as a mom.

### The Mom Wealth Gap Is Real

Studies show mothers face a wealth penalty of over $1 million compared to women without children.

But here's the truth: **Being a mom doesn't have to be a wealth disadvantage.**

In fact, the exact skills that make you an amazing mom—multitasking, efficiency, planning, nurturing—are perfect for building wealth when you use the right systems.

## Testimonials Section

### What BadAss Moms Are Saying

**"As a mom of 3 under 5, I was skeptical about adding ANYTHING else to my plate. But the bite-sized format of BAMU made it actually doable. I watched lessons while folding laundry and implemented the systems in 15-minute chunks. Six weeks in, I've launched my first digital product making $2,700/month on autopilot."**
— Jessica M., Homeschooling Mom of 3

**"I've bought so many courses I never finished because they weren't designed for mom life. BAMU is different. I can watch a 5-minute lesson during my son's therapy appointment and implement it that same day. The BadAss Mom Business Model alone helped me restructure my VA business to make an extra $1,500/month while working 10 fewer hours."**
— Tanya R., Single Mom & Virtual Assistant

**"The investment piece was a game-changer for me. I always thought investing was complicated and required hours of research. The Mom-Friendly Stock Market System helped me set up my first investment account and automated plan in less than 30 minutes. Four months later, I've built a $7K portfolio while knowing exactly what I'm doing."**
— Michelle K., Mom of Twins & Part-time Teacher

**"I went from making $1,200/month as a VA to $8K/month with digital products using the exact systems in this course. The best part? I'm working LESS and spending MORE time with my kids. This isn't just about money—it's about creating a life where you don't have to choose between wealth and family."**
— Sarah J., Mom of 4 & Digital Product Creator
