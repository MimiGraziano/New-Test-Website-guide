# Lesson 3.1: The BadAss Money Mindset Reset

## MINDSET MOMENT
"My wealth is not determined by my past, but by the beliefs I choose today. As I transform my money mindset, I transform my financial reality."

## INTRODUCTION

Welcome to Module 3, BadAss Mom! You've established your business foundation and optimized your productivity systems. Now it's time to address the final frontier of your wealth journey: your relationship with money itself.

Let's be honest—as mothers, we've inherited complex money narratives that often work against our wealth-building goals. Maybe you were taught that wanting more money is greedy. Perhaps you believe that financial abundance requires sacrificing time with your children. Or maybe you're carrying the subtle but powerful message that women, especially mothers, shouldn't be too financially ambitious.

These limiting beliefs aren't your fault, but they are your responsibility to transform. Today, we're conducting a BadAss Money Mindset Reset—identifying and rewiring the subconscious money stories that have been silently sabotaging your wealth potential.

## CORE CONCEPT: MATERNAL MONEY NARRATIVES

Maternal Money Narratives are the subconscious beliefs about wealth that specifically impact mothers. These narratives are particularly powerful because they operate at the intersection of two emotionally charged identities: womanhood and motherhood.

The four most common Maternal Money Narratives include:

1. **The Sacrifice Narrative**: "Good mothers put everyone else's needs before their own financial wellbeing."

2. **The Either/Or Narrative**: "I can either be fully present for my children OR financially successful, but not both."

3. **The Deservingness Narrative**: "Taking care of my family is enough; wanting more is selfish."

4. **The Capability Narrative**: "Managing household finances is one thing, but building wealth is beyond my abilities."

These narratives aren't random thoughts—they're deeply embedded belief systems that drive your financial behaviors, often without your conscious awareness. They influence everything from the prices you set to the investments you make (or avoid) to the opportunities you pursue (or ignore).

The good news? Once identified, these narratives can be systematically rewired through the BadAss Money Mindset Reset process.

## REAL MOM APPLICATION

Let me show you how three BadAss Moms transformed their Maternal Money Narratives:

**Elise** was raised by a single mother who constantly struggled financially. She internalized the belief that "motherhood equals financial struggle." This narrative manifested in her business as undercharging and overdelivering, keeping her income perpetually below $3,000 monthly despite working constantly. Through the Money Mindset Reset, she identified this pattern and rewrote her narrative to "My financial abundance creates security for my children." Within three months of this mindset work, she raised her prices, created stronger boundaries, and doubled her monthly income to $6,000.

**Danielle** grew up in a traditional household where her father handled all financial decisions. She internalized the belief that "complex money matters are beyond my understanding." This narrative manifested as avoiding investment opportunities and keeping her business intentionally small. Through the Money Mindset Reset, she rewrote her narrative to "My maternal intuition makes me a powerful investor and wealth builder." She subsequently invested in her first index funds, expanded her business to include a premium offering, and increased her net worth by $15,000 in six months.

**Renee** was raised in a religious community that emphasized humility and moderation. She internalized the belief that "wanting significant wealth is greedy and spiritually questionable." This narrative manifested as self-sabotage whenever her business approached six figures. Through the Money Mindset Reset, she rewrote her narrative to "My wealth is a divine tool for creating positive impact." She subsequently launched her first high-ticket program, generating $27,000 in a single month, and established a scholarship fund for single mothers in her community.

Notice that none of these women changed their external circumstances first—they changed their internal narratives, which then transformed their financial behaviors and results.

## MINDSET RESET MAPPING EXERCISE

Let's identify and transform YOUR Maternal Money Narratives right now. Grab your BadAss Mom journal and answer these questions:

**Narrative Identification:**
- What messages about money did you receive growing up?
- What did your mother's relationship with money teach you?
- What "rules" about money and motherhood do you subconsciously follow?
- When you imagine significant wealth, what fears or concerns arise?
- In what ways might you be keeping yourself financially small?

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Where in your business do you consistently undervalue yourself?
- What financial decisions do you avoid or postpone?
- When do you feel guilt or shame related to making or wanting money?
- What financial ceiling seems to exist in your business?
- How might your current money behaviors be protecting you from something?

**Narrative Transformation:**
- What new belief would better serve your wealth goals?
- What evidence exists that this new belief could be true?
- How would your financial behaviors change if you fully embodied this new belief?
- What daily practice could reinforce this new money narrative?
- How would your children benefit from you modeling this new relationship with money?

Now, craft your Money Mindset Reset Statement using this formula:

"I release the belief that [OLD NARRATIVE]. I now choose to believe that [NEW NARRATIVE]. This serves me and my family by [POSITIVE IMPACT]."

For example: "I release the belief that wanting financial abundance makes me a less present mother. I now choose to believe that my wealth creates both freedom and security for my family. This serves me and my children by modeling that mothers deserve financial abundance while creating more quality time together."

## THE BADASS MOM ADVANTAGE

Your Money Mindset Reset creates four immediate wealth advantages:

1. **Decision Acceleration**: When limiting beliefs no longer create internal resistance, financial decisions become clearer and faster.

2. **Value Alignment**: As you release guilt around charging your worth, your pricing naturally aligns with the true value you provide.

3. **Opportunity Magnetism**: When you believe you deserve wealth, you become attuned to opportunities that previously would have been invisible to you.

4. **Generational Impact**: By transforming your money narrative, you create a new financial legacy that will benefit your children and their children.

These advantages compound over time. While other entrepreneurs focus exclusively on external strategies, you're addressing the internal foundation that determines whether those strategies will actually work for you.

## ACTION ACCELERATOR

Your immediate action step is to create a visual reminder of your new Money Mindset Reset Statement. Write it on a beautiful card and place it where you'll see it daily—your bathroom mirror, your desk, or your wallet. Each time you see it, take three deep breaths and fully embody the new belief for at least 30 seconds.

This isn't just positive thinking—it's neural rewiring. Consistent reinforcement of your new narrative literally creates new neural pathways that, over time, become your default money mindset.
